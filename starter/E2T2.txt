Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Vulnerabilities and Analysis:

1. Security Groups Allow Ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to Port 22:
Issue: Allowing ingress from anywhere on port 22 (SSH) exposes the environment to potential brute force attacks and unauthorized access attempts.
Analysis: This vulnerability stems from overly permissive security group rules in the deployed environment, allowing SSH access from any IP address.

2. VPC Default Security Groups Allow Inbound or Outbound Traffic:
Issue: The default security group in the VPC allows all inbound and outbound traffic, which can lead to unintended access and data exposure.
Analysis: By default, VPC security groups may have permissive rules that do not restrict traffic, posing a security risk if not explicitly configured.

3. Security Groups Allow Ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to Port 3389:
Issue: Allowing ingress from anywhere on port 3389 (RDP) poses a significant risk, similar to the SSH port 22 issue, by exposing the system to unauthorized remote access attempts.
Analysis: This issue suggests that the security group rules were configured to allow unrestricted RDP access, which is a common vulnerability in cloud environments.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Recommendations for Remediation:

1. Restrict SSH Access (Port 22):
Recommendation: Modify the security group rules to allow SSH access only from specific, trusted IP addresses or IP ranges. If remote access is required from various locations, consider using a VPN or SSH bastion host.


2. Harden Default Security Group:
Recommendation: Modify the default security group to restrict all inbound and outbound traffic. Create specific security groups with the necessary rules for each resource, ensuring the principle of least privilege.


3. Restrict RDP Access (Port 3389):
Recommendation: Similar to SSH, restrict RDP access to specific, trusted IP addresses. Avoid allowing unrestricted access to the RDP port.
