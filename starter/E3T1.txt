Description of Findings
UnauthorizedAccess:
/SSHBruteForce findings indicate that a brute force attack was detected on EC2 instances, targeting the SSH port. 
This type of attack involves an automated attempt to guess SSH credentials to gain unauthorized access to your instance.

High Severity Finding: This finding indicates a more significant risk and requires immediate attention. 
The high severity finding is for instance i-0108b5515c017cd18, and it was observed 8 minutes ago with 2 attempts detected.

Low Severity Finding: This finding represents a less critical risk but still needs to be addressed. 
The low severity finding is for instance i-04d1ece4b9d417f29, and it was observed 9 minutes ago with 2 attempts detected.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

AWS GuardDuty using a combination of data sources and threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IP addresses and domains, 
and machine learning (ML) models to identify unexpected, and potentially unauthorized activity in your AWS environment.

Explain How GuardDuty Detects Brute Force Attacks:
CloudTrail Logs:
    Source of Information: AWS CloudTrail logs provide detailed records of API calls made within AWS account. 
    GuardDuty analyzes these logs to detect unusual or unauthorized API activity.
    Detection Method: GuardDuty identifies suspicious patterns such as frequent and failed login attempts to the EC2 instances. 
    In the case of brute force attacks, it might detect multiple failed SSH login attempts from different IP addresses, 
    which is a common indicator of brute force activity.


VPC Flow Logs:
    Source of Information: VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in  VPC.
    These logs record metadata such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, and the number of bytes transferred.
    Detection Method: GuardDuty analyzes VPC Flow Logs to detect patterns consistent with brute force attacks, 
    such as a high number of connection attempts to the SSH port (port 22) from various IP addresses.

DNS Logs:
    Source of Information: DNS logs record the DNS queries made by resources within your VPC. 
    GuardDuty can analyze these logs for unusual or suspicious domain resolution requests.
    Detection Method: While less directly related to SSH brute force attacks, DNS logs can provide additional context, 
    such as attempts to resolve known malicious domains or domains associated with botnets.

Threat Intelligence Feeds:
    Source of Information: GuardDuty uses threat intelligence feeds to identify known malicious IP addresses and other indicators of compromise.
    Detection Method: If the IP addresses making the brute force attempts are known to be associated with malicious activity, 
    GuardDuty can use this information to flag the attempts as suspicious.

Machine Learning:
    Source of Information: GuardDuty employs machine learning models to identify deviations from normal patterns of activity.
    Detection Method: These models can detect anomalies in login attempts, such as an unusually high number of failed login attempts 
    or login attempts coming from uncommon geographical locations.
